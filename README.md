# Calculator-With-Voice-Control
## Description:
Calculator with basic arithmetic functionality and has the ability to be controlled via voice control. This particular calculator could be useful for individuals who are visually impaired and/or lack the ability to manually click buttons on a calculator. 

## Language/Tools:
Used Windows Forms for the UI and C# for the logic. This particular program was an individual project in order to grasp Windows Forms within Visual Studio and to learn C# using .NET APIs and libraries.

## Limitations:
The calculator only has the ability to conduct the most basic mathematical operations (plus, minus, subtract, multiply and divide). Visual aesthetic could be improved for better user experience. Voice control is fairly slow at responding to voice, so users need to speak fairly slow for the calculator to compute operations. The voice control also lacks the ability to manually state a number, for example: users cant say 10, they must say "One" followed by a "Zero."

## Future Improvements:
Adding more mathematical operations for wider usage. Optimizing and making the design more clean for user experience. Making the voice control more fluid and more convenient/interactable with voice.
